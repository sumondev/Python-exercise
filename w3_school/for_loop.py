# n = int(input("Input a number: "))

# Assending  Order

# The syntax of the range function is as follows:
# for i in range(start, stop, step):
# For example, if the value of start = 0 and stop = length of the required list and step= 2, then the for loop will iterate over every second element in the entire list

# n = int (input("Input a number"))

# for a in range (0,n+1,2):
     
#         print( a) 

#Decending Order

n = int(input("Input a number"))
for a in range(n,-1,-1): 

    print (a)
    # here 1st n=input number, then it decrese to 0 that;s why write -1, and decase every step -1.
